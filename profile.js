In Next.js 15, issues can arise with the new App Router's parallel route handling. If multiple routes fetch data concurrently, race conditions might occur, leading to unpredictable behavior.  For instance, imagine two routes fetching data that should be mutually exclusive.  If both complete simultaneously, the application might render with inconsistent or incorrect data.

```javascript
// pages/profile.js
async function Profile() {
  const user = await fetch('/api/user').then(res => res.json());
  const posts = await fetch('/api/posts').then(res => res.json());
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      {/* ... posts ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
export default Profile; 
```

If `/api/user` and `/api/posts` have dependencies that could cause concurrency issues (e.g., modifying a shared database), unexpected results may happen.
